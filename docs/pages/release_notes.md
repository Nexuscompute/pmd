### üöÄ New and noteworthy

### üåü Rule Changes

#### Changed Rules
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldUseAfterAnnotation %} (Java Best Practices) now also considers JUnit 5 and TestNG tests.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldUseBeforeAnnotation %} (Java Best Practices) now also considers JUnit 5 and TestNG tests.

#### Renamed Rules
Several rules for unit testing have been renamed to better reflect their actual scope. Lots of them were called
after JUnit / JUnit 4, even when they applied to JUnit 5 and / or TestNG.

* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldUseAfterAnnotation %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnit4TestShouldUseAfterAnnotation`.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldUseBeforeAnnotation %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnit4TestShouldUseBeforeAnnotation`.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldUseTestAnnotation %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnit4TestShouldUseTestAnnotation`.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestAssertionsShouldIncludeMessage %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnitAssertionsShouldIncludeMessage`.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts`.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestsShouldIncludeAssert %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnitTestsShouldIncludeAssert`.

The old rule names still work but are deprecated.
