### üöÄ New and noteworthy

### üåü Rule Changes

#### Changed Rules
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldUseAfterAnnotation %} (Java Best Practices) now also considers JUnit 5 and TestNG tests.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldUseBeforeAnnotation %} (Java Best Practices) now also considers JUnit 5 and TestNG tests.

#### Renamed Rules
* Several rules for unit testing have been renamed to better reflect their actual scope. Lots of them were called
  after JUnit / JUnit 4, even when they applied to JUnit 5 and / or TestNG.
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestAssertionsShouldIncludeMessage %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnitAssertionsShouldIncludeMessage`.
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts`.
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldIncludeAssert %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnitTestsShouldIncludeAssert`.
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldUseAfterAnnotation %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnit4TestShouldUseAfterAnnotation`.
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldUseBeforeAnnotation %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnit4TestShouldUseBeforeAnnotation`.
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/UnitTestShouldUseTestAnnotation %} (Java Best Practices) has been renamed from `JUnit4TestShouldUseTestAnnotation`.

The old rule names still work but are deprecated.
